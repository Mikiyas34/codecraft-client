Thanks for wanting to contribute to Gemstone - you rock! Here's a quick guide on how you can get involved and make Gemstone even better:

Contributing to Gemstone:
Fork the Repository: Start by forking the Gemstone repository to your GitHub account. This will create a copy of the project that you can freely experiment with.
Clone the Repository: Next, clone your forked repository to your local machine using the git clone command followed by the repository's URL.
Create a Branch: Before making any changes, create a new branch to work on. This helps keep your changes isolated and makes it easier to manage multiple contributions. You can do this using the git checkout -b <branch-name> command.
Make Your Changes: Now comes the fun part! Make your desired changes or additions to the codebase. Whether it's fixing a bug, adding a new feature, or improving documentation, every contribution is valuable.
Commit Your Changes: Once you're happy with your changes, commit them to your branch using descriptive commit messages. This helps others understand the purpose of your changes. You can commit your changes using the git commit -m "Your commit message here" command.
Push Your Changes: Push your changes to your forked repository on GitHub using the git push command. This will make your changes visible to others and ready for review.
Submit a Pull Request: Finally, submit a pull request (PR) to the main Gemstone repository. In your PR, provide a clear description of the changes you've made and any relevant context. Our team will review your contribution and provide feedback if needed.
Code Guidelines:
Follow the existing code style and formatting conventions.
Write clear and concise code with meaningful variable names and comments where necessary.
Ensure your changes do not introduce any new bugs or regressions.
Test your changes thoroughly before submitting a pull request.
Communication:
Feel free to open an issue to discuss potential changes or features before starting work on them.
Stay engaged with the Gemstone community by participating in discussions and providing feedback on others' contributions.
